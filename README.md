**** PORTFOLIO DISCLAIMER
This readme was done at the last minute because I struggled HEAVELY with this assigment and wanted to make sure that my pages deployed successfully.

I started with the index page first, because I knew that if i made that page responsive, I'd be able to make the other pages responsive as well. I first got the nav bar in because that seemed the easiest, as well as the header. Then, I had to play "wack-a-mole" several times with trying to figure out the grid layout, how many rows I wanted, how many columns I needed, and how to make the page responsive. But I hope that the grid dimensions are dimensions that the viewer is satisfied with.

Once I figured out the dimensions, I was then able to put p tags and placeholder images in the index. After that, added a sticky footer, then moved onto the other pages. For the portfolio page, my instructor gave me a hint on how to go about making that page responsive, and once I made it responsive, I added the image and link to my first homework assignment. As for the contact page, I went on getbootstrap and looked at forms and found a form that looked similar to the screenshot example, and put that in my code. All pages have the same nav bar, sticky footer and background image.
